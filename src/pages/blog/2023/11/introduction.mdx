# Hey there!
<sup>Is this thing on?</sup>

Welcome to my rainy place.

## How's it work?
The majority of the work is done by Astro's amazing support for Markdown. I iterate over every post (obtained via `Astro.glob`), and map their frontmatter to an Astro component,
`PostCard` - you can see this in the header!

<br />

Since these posts are *also* marked as pages, they are instantly accessible by URL, so I can simply use their `url` property to create a standard HTML link element in the `PostCard` component.
This gives the impression that the cards navigate to the post when clicked.

<br />

You can also view The Room of Rain in your favourite RSS reader, once again thanks to Astro.
This is achieved using a route that serves data - in this case, an RSS feed generated via `import.meta.glob` and `@astrojs/rss`. Truly amazing!

## Will you actually use it this time?
<sup>*tumbleweed rolls past [my original blog](//beefers.dev/articles)*</sup>

Yes! Hopefully! There have been many cases lately where I have thought "man, I could totally write something about this", which is promising. I suppose the fact that this initial post
is so detailed is a good sign, too.
