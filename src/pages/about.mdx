# About me
Hi, I'm maisy. The `m` is usually non-capitalised. I'm a <DynamicAge birthDate="08-10-2007" /> software developer from Britain.

I am fluent in English, and have been learning German for several years now.

## Interests
* Typically, I'm either programming, doing schoolwork, or [hanging around in VRChat](//vrchat.com/home/user/usr_9999b62c-5cb1-4227-b853-dd2d13214358). My primary programming language is
TypeScript (and thus JavaScript), but I've dabbled in Python, Visual Basic, C#, Lua, Kotlin, Java, Nim, Zig, C/C++, Dart (and thus Flutter), GDScript, a very small amount of POSIX shell, and Windows Batch.

* I also make my own VRChat avatars - or, in simple terms, I enjoy praying to a higher power that the Unity Editor doesn't crash, and cursing to the very same power when it inevitably does.

* I enjoy listening to a wide variety of music, but according to [last.fm](//last.fm/user/Beeffers), I particularly enjoy electronic, rock, and indie. My favourite band overall is [Enter Shikari](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enter_Shikari).

## Facts
* My birthday is on [International Lesbian Day](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Lesbian_Day).
* My favourite food is pasta, of any type.
* Noisemaps make the best banners. [Trust me.](//i.maisy.moe/cb75c3b7a.png)

## Contact
I can be found in quite a few places across the Web. Here are some examples!
